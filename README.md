# H1_Horiseon
## Description
This is a website for the client Horiseon Social Solutions Inc and they provide services such as Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media marketing. They have asked us to check their site to make sure all links are working properly and the code is accessible and formatted properly. I have learned that clean and readable code can make a huge difference when working on someone else's code and make it much easier to fix issues with the site when they appear.
